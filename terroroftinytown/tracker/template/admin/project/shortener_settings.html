<h1>Shortener Settings</h1>

<p>Customize how the scraper will operate.</p>

{% module Form(form, submit='Apply') %}

<p>Alphabet: How to turn the sequence numbers into letters. Some common examples:</p>
<ul>
	<li>01234567890abcdef</li>
	<li>0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</li>
	<li>0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</li>
	<li>0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ_</li>
	<li>0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ-_</li>
</ul>

<p>The boxes with HTTP status codes are whitespace seperated lists.</p>

<p>A redirect status code means there is a unshortened URL. A no redirect 
status code means that there is no shortened URL. A unavailable status
code means that the shortener has content issues (like a DCMA notice) with 
unshortened URL. Banned status codes means that the scraper client
has been banned.</p>

<p>Body regex is a space for a Python regex if the shortener only serves
the unshortened URL in the HTML.</p>

<p>Script version is the minimum version of terroroftinytown required to get work from this project. Note that the client automatically updates script automatically.</p>

<p>Client version is the minimum version of terroroftinytown-client-grab which users must manually update.</p>
